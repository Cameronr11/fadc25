# Agustin Salas-Vaca

This is my final year as an undergraduate student, and I am looking forward to contributing meaningfully to the company I join after graduation. Currently, I hope that will be Pilot, where I have gained valuable experience over the past three years. My main interest is software development, and at Pilot I primarily worked on development projects. While I currently prefer web development, I am open to exploring other areas of software engineering because I truly enjoy building applications that others can use and benefit from.

I am especially excited to work with data this semester, since it is a field I have not yet had much direct experience with. I believe this course will give me an excellent opportunity to explore new approaches, broaden my skill set, and gain insights into how data can be leveraged in real-world projects.
