My name is Nagendra Upadhyay, and I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I also earned my B.S. in Computer Science. My interests span across software engineering, machine learning, and data analytics. I have professional experience in full-stack web development, control systems, and software engineering through my past internships. From this course, I want to strengthen my ability to apply computer science concepts in real-world contexts, gain deeper understanding into advanced topics in software engineering, and work on some fun projects. I aim to leave this course with practical skills that will make me more effective as a developer.
