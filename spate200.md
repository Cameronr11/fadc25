My name is Suneil Patel and I am a Master's student. I have worked in full stack development and would love to broaden my horizons into big data. My interests lie in the ability to preprocess data
efficiently and its application in the real world. Specifically, I would love to delve into the domain of fintech and possibly a stock market analysis.
